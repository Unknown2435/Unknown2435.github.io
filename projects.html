<font size="2"><h1><font face="Ariel"> I am currently working on this project caled Google-Code-In. Pre-university students ages 13 to 17 are invited to take part in Google Code-in: Our global, online, contest introducing teenagers to the world of open source. With a wide variety of bite-sized tasks, it’s easy for beginners to jump in and get started no matter what skills they have. Mentors from our participating organizations lend a helping hand as participants learn what it’s like to work on an open source project. My aim is to complete 3 tasks so that I can get the Google-Code-In T-shirt. I have been participating in this competition since 2015 and have enjoyed the process of this competition. I hope more people will be aware of this competition and take part in it.
