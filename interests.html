<font size="2"><h1><font face="Ariel"><u>Reason:</u> When playing the piano, I will feel very relaxed and I can release all my stress. I enjoy playing classical music and the latest pop songs on the piano. I have learnt it for a year and a half and will often invite my friends to come to my house to play the piano together. I was inspired by JJ Lin, a local singer-songwriter to learn to play the piano as he was my idol and I wanted to be able to play his songs on the piano.</h1>

<font size="2"><h1><font face="Ariel"><u>Reason:</u> I am a sporty person and love doing all kinds of exercise such as Basketball, Badminton and Tchoukball. However I love playing Tchoukball the most as it is very interesting and fun. Although it is not as recognised as the other two sports, I feel that in the near future, ore people will be more aware of this sport and more people would participate in this sport. I have also won several awards.
