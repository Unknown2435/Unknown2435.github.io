<font size="2"><h1><font face="Ariel"><u>Reason:</u> When playing the piano, I will feel very relaxed and I can release all my stress. I enjoy playing classical music and the latest pop songs on the piano. I have learnt it for a year and a half and will often invite my friends to come to my house to play the piano together. I was inspired by JJ Lin, a local singer-songwriter to learn to play the piano as he was my idol and I wanted to be able to play his songs on the piano.</h1>

<font size="2"><h1><font face="Ariel"><u>Reason:</u> I am a sporty person and love doing all kinds of exercise such as Basketball, Badminton and Tchoukball. However I love playing Tchoukball the most as it is very interesting and fun. Although it is not as recognised as the other two sports, I feel that in the near future, ore people will be more aware of this sport and more people would participate in this sport. I have also won several awards.

<font size="2"><h1><font face="Ariel"> I am currently working on this project caled Google-Code-In. Pre-university students ages 13 to 17 are invited to take part in Google Code-in: Our global, online, contest introducing teenagers to the world of open source. With a wide variety of bite-sized tasks, it’s easy for beginners to jump in and get started no matter what skills they have. Mentors from our participating organizations lend a helping hand as participants learn what it’s like to work on an open source project. My aim is to complete 3 tasks so that I can get the Google-Code-In T-shirt. I have been participating in this competition since 2015 and have enjoyed the process of this competition. I hope more people will be aware of this competition and take part in it.
